  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p class="subhead">
    The lute has an incredibly rich repertoire, but for people who are just getting into early music, much of it can seem inaccessible. The pieces use various notation systems, sometimes are written in barely legible handwriting or printed in awkward formats, and are hidden in manuscripts and prints scattered across hundreds of libraries and collections. The data we will be using for this project comes from the work of Sarge Gerbode, a lute enthusiast who has made it his mission to make the works of lute composers more accessible by providing them in a digital, easy-to-read format. Using scans provided by libraries, he encodes the pieces in <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/fronimo/home" target="_blank">Fromino</a>, a software designed for typesetting early music in tablature—the historical notation system used for lute music. The results of this transcription process can be found on <a href="https://wp.lutemusic.org" target="_blank">his website</a>, which to date contains more than 17,000 individual pieces for the lute. These works span a wide range of compositional styles and genres, covering large parts of the instrument’s history, though there is a clear focus on the Renaissance period.

    For each piece, various files are exported from Fromino. Among them MIDI files, which contain the musical information in an accessible format, allowing us to extract both the raw notes as well as aggregate musical features that can be used for further analysis. MIDI files can also store text, which is fortunate, as the dataset contains a number of English lute songs and French air de cours whose lyrics we can analyze using natural language processing techniques. While the files form the core data, each piece also comes with a range of metadata provided by the encoder. This includes the document from which the piece was taken and, if available, additional details such as the composer, date of publication, type of composition, and more. To further enrich the data, I also scraped two online composer databases and collected biographical data for the composers included in the dataset.

    What makes this dataset particularly interesting is that its data points represent individual pieces of music. Other data sources that are available for musicological research often provide valuable insights for music historians, but lack concrete musical content, which prevents their use in analyses of musical style and composition. The second point that stands out with regard to the dataset is its size, which is vast with over 17,000 entries. The size and variety of the data make it possible to search for broader patterns, zoom in on specific subsets, and explore relationships between them. It also helps with statistical analysis and enables the use of more data-intensive machine learning methods.
