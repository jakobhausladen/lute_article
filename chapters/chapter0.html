      Homerus zweiffelt billich wol / Ob man von Menschen glauben soll / Daß sie die Laut erfunden haben / Oder ob sie die Götter gaben: // Weils die gröst Kunst ist schönster thon / Vnd aller Instrument ein Kron / Vnd hat was himlisch lieblichkeit: / Drum schreibt er sie sei zubereit // Vom Mercurio der dieselb / Hat rund dem Himel gleich gewelbt: / Auff das sie auch recht Himlisch laut: / Kein schönerer Bau ward nie erbaut. – Johann Fischart (1546-1590)

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p class="subhead">
    In this article, we will explore a dataset of Renaissance lute compositions, compiled and transcribed by Sarge Gerbode. I have no formal musicological training and do not claim to make any substantial discoveries. Rather, the focus is methodological. My goal is to demonstrate the potential of quantitative and computational methods in early music research through a practical example. I want to convince you that musicologists and music historians can benefit from enriching their methodological toolkit or from collaborating with researchers schooled in these methods.

    The so-called “digital humanities” are a rapidly expanding branch of research. Proponents of the approach argue that data visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, and other data-based techniques can complement traditional research methods and play a fruitful role in the humanities. This includes musicological  research, where data sources like <a href="https://academic.oup.com/em/article/43/4/649/338731" target="_blank">bibliographic metadata</a>, historical records from <a href="https://musichistorystats.com/concert-programming-at-the-new-york-philharmonic/" target="_blank">newspapers</a> and <a href="https://musichistorystats.com/eighteenth-century-london-concerts-1-the-data/" target="_blank">concert halls</a>, and musical compositions present rich opportunities for applying quantitative methods. There have even been <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26417332" target="_blank">attempts</a> to employ experimental approaches.

    The quantitative approach offers two key advantages. First, it can help spot patterns in large amounts of data that might be missed when analyzing pieces individually (exploratory analysis). Second, it can be used to test concrete hypotheses (confirmatory analysis). Imagine you're a musicologist defending a hypothesis—for example, that two compositional schools differ in some dimension of style. In traditional research, you might select and analyze a few examples to support your claim. But these may not be representative and you may have been biased in the selection or analysis. By translating the claim to a testable hypothesis, you can analyze much larger samples using statistical techniques, which come with agreed on thresholds for hypothesis acceptance. This approach can help reduce the limitations of small samples and personal bias.

    This article is partly inspired by the work of Andrew Gustar, and I highly recommend checking out his <a href="https://musichistorystats.com" target="_blank">blog</a> and <a href="https://oro.open.ac.uk/41851/" target="_blank">PhD thesis</a>. I’ve tried to maintain a balance between explaining the methods while avoiding technical details. To make the article more engaging, I’ve also included some interactive elements–such as the lutenists in the left margin, who can play you some music. The article is organized as follows: we begin by describing the source and nature of our data. Next, we explore biographical data about the composers of the lute pieces. Following that, we’ll showcase the use of aggregate musical features that can be derived from the compositions. Then, we will analyze the sentiments in English lute songs. Finally, we conclude by constructing and analyzing a publication network.
